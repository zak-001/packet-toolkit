## Goals:
- [ ] Build a Python tool (using Scapy) to craft and inject custom packets (TCP, UDP, ICMP).

- [ ] Implement features like session hijacking, SYN flood simulation, and protocol fuzzing.

- [ ] Learn how IDS/IPS detect such attacks.

## Tasks:
### Week 1:
- [ ] Get the development environment ready.

- [ ] Build basic packet crafting, sending, and sniffing functionality.

- [ ] Understand Scapyâ€™s packet manipulation model.
